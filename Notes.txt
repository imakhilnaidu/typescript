-> Typescript is a programming language, which is built on top of javascript.
-> Every javascript file is a valid typescript file.
-> Typescript is nothing but, javascript with type checking.
-> We can use typescript wherever we use javascript.
-> Browser don't understand typescript, so we need a typescript compiler which will convert typescript code to plain javascript code. This process is called transpilation.
